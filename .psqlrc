-- HISTSIZE:
-- The maximum number of commands to store in the command history (default
-- 500). If set to a negative value, no limit is applied.
-- Note: This feature was shamelessly plagiarized from Bash.
\set HISTSIZE -1

-- PROMPT1, PROMPT1, PROMPT3:
-- These specify what the prompts psql issues should look like.
-- Prompt 1 is the normal prompt that is issued when psql requests a new
-- command. Default: '%/%R%x%# '
-- Prompt 2 is issued when more input is expected during command entry, for
-- example because the command was not terminated with a semicolon or a quote
-- was not closed. Default: '%/%R%x%# '
-- Prompt 3 is issued when you are running an SQL COPY FROM STDIN command and
-- you need to type in a row value on the terminal. Default: '>> '
\set PROMPT1 '%n@%M:%>/%/%R%#%x '
\set PROMPT2 '%n@%M:%>/%/ (%l) %R%#%x '
\set PROMPT3 '>> '

-- \timing [ on | off ]
-- With a parameter, turns displaying of how long each SQL statement takes on
-- or off. Without a parameter, toggles the display between on and off. The
-- display is in milliseconds; intervals longer than 1 second are also shown in
-- minutes:seconds format, with hours and days fields added if needed.
\timing on

-- COMP_KEYWORD_CASE:
-- Determines which letter case to use when completing an SQL key word. If set
-- to lower or upper, the completed word will be in lower or upper case,
-- respectively. If set to preserve-lower or preserve-upper (the default), the
-- completed word will be in the case of the word already entered, but words
-- being completed without anything entered will be in lower or upper case,
-- respectively.
\set COMP_KEYWORD_CASE preserve-upper

-- \x [ on | off | auto ]
-- Sets or toggles expanded table formatting mode. As such it is equivalent to
-- \pset expanded.
\x auto
